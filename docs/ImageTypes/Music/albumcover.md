#### __Other rules and considerations__

??? note "**Similar Images**"  

    - __Each image should be it’s own unique piece of art. __

    - __Do not submit art that is similar to art already on the site, or to your own submissions. __

    - __This includes different zoom levels of the same image, and using different logo combinations with the same images.__

    - __The only exception is the 2 language rule.__
    


??? note "**Languages**"

    - __Each user is limited to creating a piece of art in a maximum of 2 languages.__

    - __The most prominent language in the logo is what determines what language to set.__

    - __If the title of a Movie/TV Show is identical in any country to the title in English, the image MUST be uploaded as English. It is your responsibility to check [imdb](http://www.imdb.com/) or [tvdb](http://thetvdb.com/) before you upload it.__

    English is the default language as well as the fallback language in Media Centers, this will ensure the artwork is available to the widest audience possible. When we move to the new site, we will have an option to set a piece of art to multiple languages which will make this rule obsolete, but until then please observe this rule.

    We really don’t want to swamp our database with a zillion images in every possible language/format that exists. If there is an interest for some art in a language that is not available, it will prompt that user to either create that artwork themselves, or they can use the request system. This way only images that are in demand are getting produced, and we are not filling up our pages with art gathering dust.  
    
    Our goal should be to try and fill in or make artwork where there is none. This is much more helpful to the site. One look at our [Incomplete Section](https://fanart.tv/list-page/) should give plenty of opportunities for people who want to produce a lot of art and want to really help the site at the same time.
    

??? note "**PMRC Labels**"

    - __PMRC labels are only allowed when clean versions are unavailable, and removal of label would comprimise the integrity of the cover art.__

    - __PMRC labels have to meet the usual quality standards and must maintain original style/colors__

    - __Clean covers will always take precedent over PMRC covers. (They are NOT alternate versions). This means a clean cover can replace an existing PMRC cover.__
