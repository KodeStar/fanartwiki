---

## **Rules Synopsis**

* Images must be in png format sized 1000x562 pixels, no exceptions.
* Clearart should contain images of character(s) <em>or highly recognizable major items</em> from the series as well as a recognizable series logo.
* Use transparency in areas not filled with characters, logos, etc. If possible remove background elements like buildings.
* Avoid cutting off the sides of characters, never cut off the top of their heads, and do not crop off any part of the logo.
* Most skins align these on the bottom right of the screen so if you have no alternative but to crop a square edge do it on this side. No cropping of any part of the image on the top or left hand sides.
* We will NOT accept clearart with jagged edges or lazy tracing.
* Using glows should be avoided unless it is relevant to the clearart. Any clearart submitted with glows can be denied at moderators discretion.
* A limit of 4 clearart per show/movie per user. No Exceptions.
