# **Overview**

* Movie ClearARTs are images of a movie logo/name including characters of the movie with a transparent background
* Can be used while browsing your media center library to show next to the poster or as a recognizable navigation item

---

## **Rules Synopsis**

* Images must be in png format sized 1000x562 pixels, no exceptions.
* Clearart should contain images of character(s) <em>or highly recognizable major items</em> from the movie as well as a recognizable movie logo.
* Use transparency in areas not filled with characters, logos, etc. If possible remove background elements like buildings.
* Avoid cutting off the sides of characters, never cut off the top of their heads, and do not crop off any part of the logo.
* Most skins align these on the bottom right of the screen so if you have no alternative but to crop a square edge do it on this side. No cropping of any part of the image on the top or left hand sides.
* We will NOT accept clearart with jagged edges or lazy tracing.
* Using glows should be avoided unless it is relevant to the clearart. Any clearart submitted with glows can be denied at moderators discretion.
* A limit of 4 clearart per show/movie per user. No Exceptions.

## Other rules and considerations

??? note "**Similar Images**"  
    Do not try to create every type of logo/image combination you can think of. Each image should be unique and stand on it’s own. If you want to offer a different logo option, you should create an entirely new image for it instead of just slapping it onto the same image as the other logo. What you end up with is a bloated library section of basically the same images that someone has to wade though. 

    The same goes for different zoom levels of the same image, or images that are only “slightly” different from each other.  
    
    You should treat each image as it’s own unique entity and stand-alone piece of art.

??? note "**Similar Images Part 2: AKA Languages**  "
    __Each user will now be limited to creating a piece of art in a maximum of 2 languages.__

    We really don’t want to swamp our database with a zillion images in every possible language/format that exists. If there is an interest for some art in a language that is not available, it will prompt that user to either create that artwork themselves, or they can use the request system. This way only images that are in demand are getting produced, and we are not filling up our pages with art gathering dust.  
    
    Our goal should be to try and fill in or make artwork where there is none. This is much more helpful to the site. One look at our [Incomplete Section](https://fanart.tv/list-page/) should give plenty of opportunities for people who want to produce a lot of art and want to really help the site at the same time.

??? note "**Title Languages**  "
    If the title of a Movie/TV Show is identical in any country to the title in English, the image MUST be uploaded as English. It is your responsibility to check imdb or tvdb before you upload it.  
    
    English is the default language as well as the fallback language in Media Centers, this will ensure the artwork is available to the widest audience possible. When we move to the new site, we will have an option to set a piece of art to multiple languages which will make this rule obsolete, but until then please observe this rule.
