#### __Other rules and considerations__

??? note "**Similar Images**"  

    - __Each image should be itâ€™s own unique piece of art. __

    - __Do not submit art that is similar to art already on the site, or to your own submissions. __

    - __This includes different zoom levels of the same image, and using different logo combinations with the same images.__

    - __The only exception is the 2 language rule.__


??? note "**Collection Art**"
    - __Collection art should reflect characters or elements that were in all the movies.__

    The idea of collection art is to represent the entire collection, and not just one movie. This can be difficult sometimes but creativity should win out in the end if the effort is there. In the case where the main actor has changed, you could have all the main role actors in the same poster/clearart/banner etc. Or even an element that spans all the movies. Point is, if you make an art with a main character and a villain from a single movie, then that should be used for that movie and not as collection art.
