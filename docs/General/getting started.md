# __Gettin Started__
Welcome to fanart.tv and thank you for joining.We hope you enjoy this site as much as we do.

If you know your way around with graphical software consider contributing artwork for everyone to enjoy. Do note we have set some relative high standard so we only accept the â€˜bestâ€™. All artwork is moderated after it has been uploaded by users to make sure only acceptable ones end up on the site.

We have noticed that some e-mail clients automaticly move e-mail from fanart.tv to the spam/junkmail box. This causes you to not only miss the newsletters we sometimes send out but also the e-mail you receive when your uploaded artwork might be denied for a particular reason. We are seeing some great artwork being denied that just need some tiny things fixed but never hear from it again.

Note:
Please consider making a donation to pay for the server to keep this site alive.
You can also choose to support the site by becoming a VIP member. With 3 different levels available, we are able to offer some perks that are not available to standard members. Please check out the details here.

Regards,
fanart.tv team

Site Etiquette
We really are a community here and not just an image depot. We have a lot of staff and users alike that spend inordinate amounts of time managing and contributing to the most unique and extensive collection of high quality, moderated fanart anywhere.

With that in mind, please be courteous and respectful to staff and users alike. People can get very passionate about artwork and that is understandable, but not at the expense of others. We are here to help, and will as much as we are able. Use the resources put before you and contact a moderator for anything you canâ€™t figure out. We donâ€™t bite unless bitten. Remember that no one gets paid here.

Your input is most welcome and encouraged. Here are a few ways you can help enrich our site and in return, your media fanart.

It is good form to thank for any request fulfillments. This can be as simple as a pm to the person, a thank you in chat, a comment on the art in the activity stream, and a thumbs up vote is always welcome. Encouragement is a powerful tool.

fanart.tv - Vote 

Voting will promote images to be the default download through media center scrapers. Putting the best art in this slot is a no brainer, but it takes votes to do it. Exercise your right to vote. ðŸ™‚

Commenting on art in the activity stream is another great way to be a part of the community. Feedback is what drives the type of art that people want to see. The more we hear from you, the more likely we will hear you.

Tagging your comments  site-wide with a personâ€™s nick preceded by the @ symbol will leave that person a notification that they were mentioned. Good to use even if you arenâ€™t looking for a reply. (ex. akovia = @akovia or nick_name = @nickname)
Good use of common courtesy and common sense will get you far here.
