!!! info
    The rules have evolved with the site over time, so not every image has been moderated by the same rules. Some images have been "*Grandfathered in*" for now, but my be subject to replacement as time goes on.

    Two examples are the __ClearLOGO__ and __ClearArt__ sections you will find in the library. These image types have been replaced with higher definition versions that are twice the resolution. 

    __HDClearLOGO__ and __HDClearART__. 

    The low resolution types have now been deprecated. They are still present in the library and are avialable for download, but submissions of these types are no longer accepted.

!!! warning
    __We have noticed that some e-mail clients automaticly move e-mail from fanart.tv to the spam/junkmail box. This causes you to not only miss the newsletters we sometimes send out but also the e-mail you receive when your uploaded artwork might be denied for a particular reason. We are seeing some great artwork being denied that just need some tiny things fixed but never hear from the submitter again.__
