# __General Rules and Vision__

Thank you for considering to contribute to Fanart.tv. Please take the time read through this page to save both you and the volunteer staff here time and frustration. Knowing the site motto will help to understand the standards we set.

## **No Image is Better Than a Low Quality Image**

---
We understand that sometimes there just aren’t very good sources to work with, but in those cases you should either get very creative and do your best to re-create the art in higher quality, or upload it to one of the many other fanart sites that don’t moderate. Our goal is not to have an image for every single show/movie/album, but to have a Great Image for every single show/movie/album. It’s also a good thing to remember that just because an image doesn’t work well for our library here, doesn’t mean you can’t use it in your own media center. If you think your image is perfectly fine for your needs, then you should use it on your system.

You will find a bulletpoint list of rules for each image type we host and you should read and understand each one. You should ask in the [Forums](https://forum.fanart.tv/index.php), or on [Discord](https://discord.gg/r9VufRk) if you are having trouble understanding the rules. This is preferred over sending a PM to a mod as the question can serve to help others in the future.


### **Submitting Quality artwork**  
Trying to grind through the missing art in your library may cloud your judgement of what’s good and what’s “good enough“. Uploading every image you make with no interest whether it passes or not, is not acceptable.  
Try to be confident before uploading so you are not stealing a moderators time and wasting your own. Our site is full of [Tutorials](https://fanart.tv/tutorials/) and other helpful information to help you create quality artwork. 


### **Point System**
We have a point system that assigns point values to different types of art, and keeps track of the [total amount of point per user](https://fanart.tv/contributors/).

This was always meant to be a way to display the hard work our contributors have put into improving the site. It was never meant to be a competition.

Unfortunately some people just can't help themselves and feel they must "win" whenever points are involved. This leads to poor quality uploads that actually take away from contributing to the site. First by trying to submit just passable images instead of great images, and it steals the time of our volunteer Moderators. 

Users thought to be engaging in point hunting will kindly be asked to stop, and may be put on probation or even loose uploading privileges. 


### **Voting**
We also have a Voting/Like system in place so you can show an artist when you really apprecaite their submissions. We encourage people to vote and vote often. This will help the best art on the site to get recognition and will also inspire the artists to continue contibuting to the site.

As happenes with the point system, some people feel they must win at votes. There have been many incidents where single users were found using multiple accounts to inflate the vote counts on their own images. This is a violation of the rules here, and a violation of trust. Artifically inflating votes does nothing to help the site and most of the time hurts the site. Violators will be dealt with harshly.
