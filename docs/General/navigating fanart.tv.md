Site Etiquette
We really are a community here and not just an image depot. We have a lot of staff and users alike that spend inordinate amounts of time managing and contributing to the most unique and extensive collection of high quality, moderated fanart anywhere.

With that in mind, please be courteous and respectful to staff and users alike. People can get very passionate about artwork and that is understandable, but not at the expense of others. We are here to help, and will as much as we are able. Use the resources put before you and contact a moderator for anything you can’t figure out. We don’t bite unless bitten. Remember that no one gets paid here.

Your input is most welcome and encouraged. Here are a few ways you can help enrich our site and in return, your media fanart.

It is good form to thank for any request fulfillments. This can be as simple as a pm to the person, a thank you in chat, a comment on the art in the activity stream, and a thumbs up vote is always welcome. Encouragement is a powerful tool.

fanart.tv - Vote 

Voting will promote images to be the default download through media center scrapers. Putting the best art in this slot is a no brainer, but it takes votes to do it. Exercise your right to vote. 🙂

Commenting on art in the activity stream is another great way to be a part of the community. Feedback is what drives the type of art that people want to see. The more we hear from you, the more likely we will hear you.

Tagging your comments  site-wide with a person’s nick preceded by the @ symbol will leave that person a notification that they were mentioned. Good to use even if you aren’t looking for a reply. (ex. akovia = @akovia or nick_name = @nickname)
Good use of common courtesy and common sense will get you far here.
