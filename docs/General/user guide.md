# __User Guide__

If you are reading this, you most likely care about the artwork in your media center and want full control of it.

We've got you covered.

This guide is aimed as users who are here to download art, but are not considering [contribting artwork](contributor guide.md) themselves.

Not everyone has the abilities to create artwork and that's perfectly fine. Our library is open to anyone.

We also maintain a request system for when the art you need is not already in our system.
