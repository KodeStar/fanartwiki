# __User Guide__




Sorry about this, but your Clearlogo was reported for being similar to an existing Clearlogo. This happened because there were actually 2 IDs for this show at one time and then thetvdb.org merged them. So I had to merge them on the site as well and now have to clean up the duplicates and similar images. The only fair way to do it is to go by who uploaded it first.
Searching for a show on our site AND on thetvdb.org is the best way to avoid this happening in the future. This should show you when we might have multiple IDs for a show and then you can upload to the correct ID, and not duplicate artwork that was already done.
Please report when you find multiple IDs and we will merge them.
