# __Fanart Help__

Fanart.tv has a lot of resources available to help with just about anything. Finding that information is another matter altogether. This tutorial should help you find that information so you can unlock the mysteries of the universe. Not really, but maybe you can find the answer to your fanart related question.

DISCORD SERVER
BEST FOR:

General Help
Quick Responses
Discord is our live chat server. It’s a bit like IRC (Internet Relay Chat) on steroids.


There are many different channels on the server, so try to make sure you are posting in the proper channel to give you the best chance to have your question answered.

If someone is in the channel, you will most likely get an answer right away. If you need help with Discord itself, there is a big ? in the top right-hand corner of the screen that will take you to the Discord help center.

FORUMS
BEST FOR:

Ongoing Discussions
Feature Requests
Feedback
The forums are not used as much any more, but they are still a valuable resource for archived information, and it is still the best platform for some discussions where not everyone is present at the same time.


If the other help resources don’t quite fit your needs, the forums is probably the place you are looking for.
