LOOKING FOR MODERATORS
We usually do not have an open call for moderators and try to contact people individually that have consistently shown great artwork with little to no denials for a steady period of time. This doesn’t mean that if you’ve had lots of denials in the past that you wouldn’t be considered. If that was the case, we wouldn’t have very many mods at all. ;)

It does require a specific skill set though to be an effective moderator:

Must be a good communicator.
Must be able to guide beginners on how to get their art approved.
Must be knowledgeable about the rules for the images they moderate.
Should generally try to be active in the community.
Must try to be available to help out with some regularity.
Being multi-lingual is a huge plus.
On top of these skills, you must meet the following requirements:

Must have at least 200 images approved.
Must be able to join the Discord channel and log in to it at least whenever you are moderating images.
Have read through most of the Tutorials & Forums so you are able to direct people with denied images to the proper resources on the site.
Must have a decent calibrated monitor to be able to spot level problems correctly – How to Calibrate your Monitor
Once you are an established moderator you will no longer be required to hang out in the channel unless you want to. This is only to establish that you are getting off on the right foot and are able to quickly ask questions and get help while you are learning the ropes.

There are not a lot of perks for being a moderator. It can be work at times, but also very rewarding.

If you haven’t run off yet screaming for your teddy bear, you might just be the person we are looking for.
Please contact a moderator or an admin on the Discord Channel if you are interested and we will see if it’s a fit. :)

MODERATOR EXPECTATIONS
Let me start off by saying that I understand that real life takes precedent over this volunteer work and this is understood. Unfortunately we still need people to be active to be a mod. People use the mod list to get help and expect someone to be there, and on the same token, the other mods expect to get some help as well. If you would rather be just a contributor, there’s nothing wrong with that, but the mod status isn’t necessary for that.

First and foremost on the list is to pull your own weight. Nothing is worse than seeing a mod upload a bunch of images but won’t take the time to moderate any. This is no different than a regular user having mod status.
Secondly, we need people that will help guide the contributors to get their artwork approved. Just denying for problems without giving some clues on how to fix it just makes for more work in the future when they keep making the same mistakes. You are not expected to tell someone how to do everything of course, but you can point them to the resources we have on the site that cover just about every problem.
Another thing to keep in mind is to be professional and not rude. Comment like “I don’t like it” are inappropriate. Most people are pretty sensitive about the art they create and that’s just a slap in the face. If you don’t like it, explain why so they can fix it. With that said, there are always a few people that just don’t listen and these people can get under your skin. You can use some harsher tactics at this point, but please try to keep it civil. Keeping responses terse is fine, but try to give them some useful feedback so they can fix the problems.
Keep the other mods informed of your status. If you want to keep your mod status but need some time away, let us know about it. You can post here in the mod forums about your absence and you don’t need to give a reason, but at least we’ll know that you won’t be around for a while. This makes it easier for the rest of us so we know who we can count on and who is inactive. Just disappearing for 6 months and returning again expecting to be a mod might not happen anymore.
There are plenty of people that join the site to do their own collections and actually have a good skill set to be a mod. Of course I’d love them to stick around after they are done, but most of them move on and only come back from time to time to update their own collections. I don’t have a problem with this, but if you want to keep your mod status, you should be somewhat active on a regular basis.

People who have been mods before and have been deactivated are free to request to have their mod status reinstated, but it will be handled on a per person basis depending on their previous history. They will also need to be up on the latest site changes and rules.

Our mod list is very long with the bulk of people not doing any modding or contributing. We are going to start pruning the list on a regular basis to help keep it up to date with active mods. (maybe every 3 months)
Again, there is nothing wrong with just wanting to be a contributor, but mod status is not required for that.
