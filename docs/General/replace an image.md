# **How to Replace an Existing Image.**

This is not something that should be taken lightly and **abuse of this system will not be tolerated.** When you are attempting to replace an existing image, you are effectively erasing someone else's hard work. Keep this in mind before requesting a replacement.

We always want the very best images and sometimes new images become available that were not available to the original submitter. Sometimes an image was approved that shouldn't have been. There are many reasons to request to replace an image. Just make sure to follow these rules and there shouldn't be any issues.

The image you submit must be **Instantly** recognizable as a superior image. If you can't meet this requirement, then please don't waste our time or your own. Replacing an image is an involved process and we don't have time to nit-pick tiny imperfections. Submit a fantastic image, and it should be smooth sailing.

Lastly, the original submitter will always get the first crack at replacing their own image with a better one. When an replacement request is submitted, the original submitter will be notified that they have 7 days to submit a replacement. If they meet the requirement, the image will be replaced by them and that will be the end of it.

##__6.) Submissions are moderated__

* A moderator will determine if any of the submissions meet the requirements to replace the existing image. 

* The best image will be chosen to be the replacement.

* The original submitter will win all ties.

* If no submission can overcome the superior image threshold, the submissions will be denied and given one chance to make an acceptable replacement. First submission at that point will be accepted.

* Image will be marked **<u>Image is fine</u>**, if no replacement is deemed acceptable.

`If the moderator uses Imagus, they can switch back and forth between the two images easily to determine if itâ€™s a superior image.`
