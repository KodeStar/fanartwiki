# __Imagus Guide__

Imagus is a browser extension that allows for enlarging images on web pages without having to open up that page. This extension has many benefits for daily browsing of the internet, but it's an invaluable tool for finding and viewing mass amounts of images quickly. This makes it the perfect tool for Fanart.tv moderators and users alike.
